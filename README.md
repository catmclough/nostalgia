Nostalgia was originally formed as a submission for DevBootcamp's 'Beautiful and Meaningful' project. Created by myself, Alex Green, and Greg Ptasinski, this Rails app allowed us to explore the implementation of OAuth, the Flickr API, and a full stack Rails app.

With cameras in their pockets, people tend to take more photos that they can possibly remember to reflect on. In order to remind people of their memories and past experiences, we built an app that pulls a random photo from a user's Flickr account and displays it to them upon login. Ultimately, we'd like to transform this app into a service that sends a user's random photo to their email inbox so happy memories can be delivered without the need to visit a website or log in.
